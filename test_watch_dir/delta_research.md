# Delta Research Findings Summary

## Research Objectives

The Delta research project aimed to investigate novel approaches to data compression and storage optimization.

## Methodology

We conducted experiments using various compression algorithms including:
- LZ77 variants
- Huffman encoding
- Arithmetic coding
- Dictionary-based methods

## Results

Our findings indicate that a hybrid approach combining dictionary-based compression with arithmetic coding yields the best results, achieving 60% compression ratio on average.

## Conclusion

The Delta research has successfully identified optimal compression strategies for our use case.
